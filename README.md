# Quadratic Voting

A simple framework for quadratic voting.

## Haskell Implementation

State transitions are handled using haskell types to make the voting system reliable and make it easier to transition to a formally verified version the program.

### Build

```sh
ghc haskell/main.hs
./haskell/main
```
